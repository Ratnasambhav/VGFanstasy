Our submission for VainGlory API Challenge 2017.
It is a fantasy game based out of game results provided by the vainglory API. 
Similar to any fantasy game, the hero gets stronger in VGFantasy if they are victorious in VainGlory matches.
So the more the hero is played in VainGlory the more chances your team has of winning in VGFantasy.
Hero,Roles and Build are taken into consideration for deciding the victor.
There are no restrictions in making your build, So just GO CRAZZZYYY!
